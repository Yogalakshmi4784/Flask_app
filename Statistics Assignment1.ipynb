Discrete is represented in numbers as whole numbers eg: Number of shows in theatre and Continuous is represented in decimal or floating numbers eg: Temperature at a place. Qualitative is further divided into Nominal and Ordinal. Nominal data is represented  as fixed set of categories and cannot be ranked eg: Gender, blood group whereas ORdinal is represented as categories with ranking, eg: Ratings for a hotel such as Excellent, Good, Average, Poor, Worst."
